# Plugin bundles

Ava-Claw supports one shared class of external plugin package: **bundle
plugins**.

Today that means three closely related ecosystems:

- Codex bundles
- Claude bundles
- Cursor bundles

Ava-Claw shows all of them as `Format: bundle` in `avaclaw plugins list`.
Verbose output and `avaclaw plugins info <id>` also show the subtype
(`codex`, `claude`, or `cursor`).

## What a bundle is

A bundle is a **content/metadata pack**, not a native in-process Ava-Claw
plugin.

Today, Ava-Claw does **not** execute bundle runtime code in-process. Instead,
it detects known bundle files, reads the metadata, and maps supported bundle
content into native Ava-Claw surfaces such as skills, hook packs, MCP config,
and embedded Pi settings.

That is the main trust boundary:

- native Ava-Claw plugin: runtime module executes in-process
- bundle: metadata/content pack, with selective feature mapping

## Shared bundle model

Codex, Claude, and Cursor bundles are similar enough that Ava-Claw treats them
as one normalized model.

Shared idea:

- a small manifest file, or a default directory layout
- one or more content roots such as `skills/` or `commands/`
- optional tool/runtime metadata such as MCP, hooks, agents, or LSP
- install as a directory or archive, then enable in the normal plugin list

Common Ava-Claw behavior:

- detect the bundle subtype
- normalize it into one internal bundle record
- map supported parts into native Ava-Claw features
- report unsupported parts as detected-but-not-wired capabilities

In practice, most users do not need to think about the vendor-specific format
first. The more useful question is: which bundle surfaces does Ava-Claw map
today?

## Detection order

Ava-Claw prefers native Ava-Claw plugin/package layouts before bundle handling.

Practical effect:

- `avaclaw.plugin.json` wins over bundle detection
- package installs with valid `package.json` + `avaclaw.extensions` use the
  native install path
- if a directory contains both native and bundle metadata, Ava-Claw treats it
  as native first

That avoids partially installing a dual-format package as a bundle and then
loading it later as a native plugin.

## What works today

Ava-Claw normalizes bundle metadata into one internal bundle record, then maps
supported surfaces into existing native behavior.

### Supported now

#### Skill content

- bundle skill roots load as normal Ava-Claw skill roots
- Claude `commands` roots are treated as additional skill roots
- Cursor `.cursor/commands` roots are treated as additional skill roots

This means Claude markdown command files work through the normal Ava-Claw skill
loader. Cursor command markdown works through the same path.

#### Hook packs

- bundle hook roots work **only** when they use the normal Ava-Claw hook-pack
  layout. Today this is primarily the Codex-compatible case:
  - `HOOK.md`
  - `handler.ts` or `handler.js`

#### MCP for CLI backends

- enabled bundles can contribute MCP server config
- current runtime wiring is used by the `claude-cli` backend
- Ava-Claw merges bundle MCP config into the backend `--mcp-config` file

#### Embedded Pi settings

- Claude `settings.json` is imported as default embedded Pi settings when the
  bundle is enabled
- Ava-Claw sanitizes shell override keys before applying them

Sanitized keys:

- `shellPath`
- `shellCommandPrefix`

### Detected but not executed

These surfaces are detected, shown in bundle capabilities, and may appear in
diagnostics/info output, but Ava-Claw does not run them yet:

- Claude `agents`
- Claude `hooks.json` automation
- Claude `lspServers`
- Claude `outputStyles`
- Cursor `.cursor/agents`
- Cursor `.cursor/hooks.json`
- Cursor `.cursor/rules`
- Cursor `mcpServers` outside the current mapped runtime paths
- Codex inline/app metadata beyond capability reporting

## Capability reporting

`avaclaw plugins info <id>` shows bundle capabilities from the normalized
bundle record.

Supported capabilities are loaded quietly. Unsupported capabilities produce a
warning such as:

```text
bundle capability detected but not wired into Ava-Claw yet: agents
```

Current exceptions:

- Claude `commands` is considered supported because it maps to skills
- Claude `settings` is considered supported because it maps to embedded Pi settings
- Cursor `commands` is considered supported because it maps to skills
- bundle MCP is considered supported where Ava-Claw actually imports it
- Codex `hooks` is considered supported only for Ava-Claw hook-pack layouts

## Format differences

The formats are close, but not byte-for-byte identical. These are the practical
differences that matter in Ava-Claw.

### Codex

Typical markers:

- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
- optional `skills/`
- optional `hooks/`
- optional `.mcp.json`
- optional `.app.json`

Codex bundles fit Ava-Claw best when they use skill roots and Ava-Claw-style
hook-pack directories.

### Claude

Ava-Claw supports both:

- manifest-based Claude bundles: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- manifestless Claude bundles that use the default Claude layout

Default Claude layout markers Ava-Claw recognizes:

- `skills/`
- `commands/`
- `agents/`
- `hooks/hooks.json`
- `.mcp.json`
- `.lsp.json`
- `settings.json`

Claude-specific notes:

- `commands/` is treated like skill content
- `settings.json` is imported into embedded Pi settings
- `hooks/hooks.json` is detected, but not executed as Claude automation

### Cursor

Typical markers:

- `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`
- optional `skills/`
- optional `.cursor/commands/`
- optional `.cursor/agents/`
- optional `.cursor/rules/`
- optional `.cursor/hooks.json`
- optional `.mcp.json`

Cursor-specific notes:

- `.cursor/commands/` is treated like skill content
- `.cursor/rules/`, `.cursor/agents/`, and `.cursor/hooks.json` are
  detect-only today

## Claude custom paths

Claude bundle manifests can declare custom component paths. Ava-Claw treats
those paths as **additive**, not replacing defaults.

Currently recognized custom path keys:

- `skills`
- `commands`
- `agents`
- `hooks`
- `mcpServers`
- `lspServers`
- `outputStyles`

Examples:

- default `commands/` plus manifest `commands: "extra-commands"` =>
  Ava-Claw scans both
- default `skills/` plus manifest `skills: ["team-skills"]` =>
  Ava-Claw scans both

## Security model

Bundle support is intentionally narrower than native plugin support.

Current behavior:

- bundle discovery reads files inside the plugin root with boundary checks
- skills and hook-pack paths must stay inside the plugin root
- bundle settings files are read with the same boundary checks
- Ava-Claw does not execute arbitrary bundle runtime code in-process

This makes bundle support safer by default than native plugin modules, but you
should still treat third-party bundles as trusted content for the features they
do expose.

## Install examples

```bash
avaclaw plugins install ./my-codex-bundle
avaclaw plugins install ./my-claude-bundle
avaclaw plugins install ./my-cursor-bundle
avaclaw plugins install ./my-bundle.tgz
avaclaw plugins info my-bundle
```

If the directory is a native Ava-Claw plugin/package, the native install path
still wins.

## Troubleshooting

### Bundle is detected but capabilities do not run

Check `avaclaw plugins info <id>`.

If the capability is listed but Ava-Claw says it is not wired yet, that is a
real product limit, not a broken install.

### Claude command files do not appear

Make sure the bundle is enabled and the markdown files are inside a detected
`commands` root or `skills` root.

### Claude settings do not apply

Current support is limited to embedded Pi settings from `settings.json`.
Ava-Claw does not treat bundle settings as raw Ava-Claw config patches.

### Claude hooks do not execute

`hooks/hooks.json` is only detected today.

If you need runnable bundle hooks today, use the normal Ava-Claw hook-pack
layout through a supported Codex hook root or ship a native Ava-Claw plugin.
